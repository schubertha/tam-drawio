# tam-drawio
A [draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) plugin which offers TAM notation


TAM is a subset of UML2 and FMC (Fundamental Modeling Concepts) block diagrams based on DIN 66200 - (Data processing systems operation; concepts, job relationships
STANDARD by Deutsches Institut Fur Normung E.V. (German National Standard), 03/01/1992)

For more information on TAM Notation, see [here](http://www.fmc-modeling.org/notation_reference)

draw.io is an open-source for web-based diagramming tool. It can be downloaded to run as a desktop application or consumed from [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) 

This plugin adds some components to draw.io, which cover the common components used in TAM's block diagrams.


## How to install

- First you need to have the file `tam-drawio.js` on your local file system
- Simple way to do so is to clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/ariel-bentu/tam-drawio`

### Install in draw.io desktop

- Goto Menu `Extras->Plugins...`
- Press `Add`
- browse and select `tam-drawio.js`
- Press `Apply`
- Restart Drawio




> in some cases if you re-install the plugin, you get the error "File Already Exists". then go to the `<appData>/draw.io/plugins` and remove the file manually before re-installing.

```
<appData> is:
- %APPDATA%   on Windows
- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or ~/.config   on Linux
- ~/Library/Application Support   on macOS
```

### Install in VSCode
- Assuming you have Drawio vs-code extension. If not: [Get It](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio)
- Open the Settings
- Search for `plugins`
- Find the `Draw.io Integration` under `Extensions`
- Select the `Hediet > VSCode-drawio: Plugins`
- Choose to `edit in Settings.json`
- Add an entry to the array:
```
"hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins": [
    {"file":"path/to/file/tam-drawio.js"}
]
```
- Restart VSCode
- You will be prompted to Allow this plugin (once ever)
- Allow and you are good to go

### Install in app.diagrams.net
- This seems to be blocked by an allowed-list burned in app.diagrams.net.
- If anyone has an idea how to change that please speak-up

### Configuration:
- Adding hidden text in the model for those who do not have the plugin:

#### Desktop version
Menu Extras --> Configuration
```json
{
  "tam": {
    "addPluginMissingLabel": true
  }
}
```

#### VSCode
this is blocked at the moment. (https://github.com/hediet/vscode-drawio/issues/298)
So for now, if you wish to disable this functionality, please change in line 2:
```javascript
let addPluginMissingLabel = false;
```


## Usage tips
- When using the using-edge (the line with circle and "R" and arrow), you can flip the direction by selecting the edge and pressing the new button on the toolbar (tooltip: Flip Use Direction).
- Use direction and side, can be controlled by the Style.
- If you send the model to another person, that other person would need the TAM plugin to view it properly.

Therefore, the plugin adds a hidden text saying: `Best viewed with the TAM plugin` with a link to this repo. This text field is hidden as long as you have the plugin installed. Anyone without a plugin, will see this text item. (this is also hidden in the svg representation of a model).

To disable this behavior, see the configuration section above
- You may save a diagram file as "editable vector image (.svg)", then it gets saved as an svg with the drawio diagram embedded. this is useful for embedding into markdown files without maintaining two files - one for the diagram source and one for embedding into markdown.
